# MyReads Project

This project is part of Udacity's FEND nanodegree - final assessment for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal was to create an app letting the user manage their bookshelves. This project is based on a template providing a static example of the CSS and HTML markup, but without any of the React code that was needed to complete the project. The developer's job was to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template.


## Setup

After cloning the git repository, run:

- `npm install`, then `npm start`
or
- `yarn install`, then `yarn start`


### App manual

This app shows 3 bookshelves: "Currently Reading", "Want to Read" and "Read". The user can move their books. Every book instance has got a control tied to them. This functionality allows to move any given book to a different shelf. The app has also got a search page. After displaying search results, this section allows the user to select "Currently Reading", "Want to Read", or "Read" to place the book in a certain shelf.
